- Elenco

Integrated circuits
- Dual inline packaging.
- Pinouts to make sense of inputs and outputs.
- TTL vs CMOS. CMOS more sensitive, more expensive, lower power. I have TTL ICs.

TTL family
- 5 volts.
- 7400 series: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_7400-series_integrated_circuits
- 7400 NAND
- 7402 NOR
- 7408 AND
- 7432 OR
- 7486 XOR
- 74266 XNOR
- 7447 BCD (binary-coded decimal) to 7seg
- 7474 D flip-flop
- 7475 Bistable latch (don't remember what this is?)
- 74148 Decimal to BCD encoder
- 7476 JK flip-flop

Other notes
- Synchronous versus asynchronous sequential logic. Difference is how the clock signal is propagated through the circuit.
